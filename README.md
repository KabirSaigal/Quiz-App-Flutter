# quiz_app

A new Flutter project of a Quiz which allows us to save the answers we enter and display different colors 
depending on if you choose the correct answer or not, along with the option to restart the quiz.
The questions of the quiz are dynamic and are stored in the data folder in the file labled questions.dart

## Getting Started

This is one the projects I am doing in order to further learn more about the Flutter development
using Dart programming, I am excited to learn more about this language.
